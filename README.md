🧬 Fossils And Genetics Craft 🧬
A Minecraft Forge 1.21.1 Mod About Dinosaurs, DNA, and Advanced Genetics

🔬 About the Mod
DinoGenetics is a science-focused Minecraft mod centered around advanced genetics, prehistoric life, and the construction and manipulation of DNA. 
Whether you're splicing genomes, reviving extinct species, or building a cutting-edge genetics lab in your survival world, 
this mod adds a rich progression system rooted in bioengineering and discovery.
This mod blends scientific realism with imaginative gameplay. Explore fossil-rich biomes, extract and sequence ancient DNA, 
fill in the gaps with modern species, and bring dinosaurs back to life—with the help of high-tech machinery and a bit of ingenuity.

🦖 Core Features
Amber & Fossils: Discover ancient remains buried in the world, mine Amber Ore and Fossilized Stone, and extract genetic material.
DNA Extraction & Sequencing: Use lab equipment to extract, purify, and sequence DNA strands from ancient sources.
Genome Assembly: Combine ancient DNA with modern analogs to reconstruct viable genomes.
Dinosaur Creation: Incubate reconstructed DNA into eggs and grow your own dinosaurs.
Laboratory Machines: Modular machines to manage everything from gene mapping to experimental synthesis.
Genetic Research System: Discover new breakthroughs and improve your DNA reconstruction accuracy.
Late-game Science: Dive into advanced systems like Nanopore Sequencing, synthetic genomes, and genetic stability management.

🔧 Requirements & Compatibility
This mod is currently in active development for Minecraft Forge 1.21.1.

## 💾 Installation
1. Ensure you have Minecraft Forge 1.21.1 installed.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from the [Releases page](link-to-releases-page-if-available).

🧩 Dependencies
Forge 1.21.1

Alchemistry – Required for chemistry-based interactions and DNA component synthesis // **NOTE THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, WAITING FOR ALCHEMISTRY TO UPDATE TO 1.21.1**

🤝 Compatibility Goals
The mod is being built with interoperability in mind. Planned integrations include:

✅ Create – Use Create contraptions to automate DNA pipelines and lab machinery

✅ MineColonies – Assign geneticists and paleobotanists to colony science labs

🧪 Getting Started
Find Fossils – Explore caves and dig sites for Amber Ore and Fossilized Stone.
Extract DNA – Use lab equipment to break down fossils into partial DNA.
Research Genes – Sequence ancient samples and identify missing genome slots.
Fill Gaps – Use modern DNA or Filler DNA to complete genomes.
Grow Dinosaurs – Once a viable genome is assembled, incubate and grow prehistoric creatures.

🛠️ Development
This mod is still in early development (v0.0.6). Expect ongoing feature additions, balancing, and structural changes.
